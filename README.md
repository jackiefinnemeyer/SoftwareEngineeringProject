# Software Engineering Project

This repository contains files from my final project in the Software Engineering for Electrical Engineers course at USC, Spring 2022.

The project was a collaborative effort between myself and two teammates. I was responsible for writing the driver code, and 
contributed equally to all other program and header files within the project.

Driver code is found in test_contact.cpp and test_network.cpp. It functions as test code.

The purpose of the project was to create a database of contact information using linked lists and objects. The project 
demonstrates proficiency in class definition with emphasis on access modifiers, inheritance, object instantiation using default and parameterized constructors, 
utilization of get and set methods. Further, it implements a linked list and uses this data structure to store and iterate through
each contact stored in the database.
